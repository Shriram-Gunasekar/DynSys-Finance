# DynSys-Finance

Description:
This repository focuses on implementing and exploring various dynamical systems methods in finance-related topics. It covers concepts such as isocline, isoquant, isocost, martingale, random Wiener processes, Pontryagin's maximum principle, and the Kalman filter with Merton's KMV model. These methods are crucial for analyzing financial systems, risk management, asset pricing, and portfolio optimization.

Key Features:

    Implementation of dynamical systems methods in finance using Python.
    Examples and applications of isocline, isoquant, isocost, martingale, random Wiener processes, 
    Pontryagin's maximum principle, and the Kalman filter with Merton's KMV model.
